# Control_Systems_Solver
This repo is a collection of functions and tools that will help solving control systems problems.
Right now the PD solver is in-complete, the plan is to have kp progress though the root locus path to find a 
the needed imaginary pole componen. More info will be released as progress is made.

Anyone is welcome to contribute
