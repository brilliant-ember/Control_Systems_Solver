# Control_Systems_Solver
This repo is a collection of functions and tools that will help solving control systems problems.
It is based on 2nd order approximations.

To use, open the jupyter notebook file PID_designer_notebook.ipynb, and run the code cells in it to be able to solve:
1. Conversion from overshoot to damping ratio and vice versa --2nd order approximaiton
2. Find zero locations and derivative gain for PD controller from desired pole location.
3. Get the polynomial needed to preform Routh-Hurwitz stability criterion from state space representaion .

Anyone is welcome to contribute
